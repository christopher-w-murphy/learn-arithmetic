# Learn Arithmetic
I'm about to be an uncle for a first time, so I recreated a game that helped me learn arithmetic in my early childhood as a simple Streamlit app.
The app is [deployed](https://learn-arithmetic.streamlit.app) on the Streamlit cloud.
If you'd instead prefer to run it locally, there are instructions below.
Either way, hopefully the game itself is self-explanatory.

## Install and Run Locally
```shell
git clone https://github.com/christopher-w-murphy/learn-arithmetic.git
cd learn-arithmetic/
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run üè†_Home.py
```
