# Learn Arithmetic
I'm about to be an uncle for a first time, so I recreated a game as a simple Streamlit app that helped me learn arithmetic in my early childhood.
Hopefully the game itself is self-explanatory.
Below are instructions for installing and running locally.

## Install and Run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/christopher-w-murphy/learn-arithmetic.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
